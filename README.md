## Overview

The AI Interview Mock Application allows users to:
1. **Log in securely** using Clerk authentication.
2. **Enter job details** such as job description, job position, tech stack, years of experience, etc.
3. **Generate mock interview questions and answers** via the Gemini API based on the provided job details. These questions and answers are stored in a Neon DB.
4. **Start a simulated interview**, where the userâ€™s speech is converted to text using the React Hook Speech-to-Text library.
5. **Receive feedback and ratings** for each answer via another call to the Gemini API. The feedback and ratings are stored in a separate Neon DB table.
6. **Access a Dashboard** where users can review past interview experiences, learn from the feedback, and prepare for upcoming interviews.
